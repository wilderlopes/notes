During my career so far, and specially now as I build ogre.run, I have stumbled upon many new insights on what makes a dev tool great.

Today I ran into a post that is very much aligned with my own thinking I have been developing throughout the years: [Two types of time](https://medium.com/@graphmaven/two-types-of-time-222a1a1d3dc), by Adam Frankl (JFrog, Neo4j, & Sourcegraph).

His main takeaway is that, similarly to my own experience, *"devs hate waste"*. And waste of developer time is the worst type of waste.

This way, dev tools that focus on maximizing dev/time performance are the ones that will catch the eyes of developers. Those type of tools are essentially time machines
that keep generating extra time to devs, who can then use it the best way they see fit -- but most probably, they will reinvest this "magically" gained time into
their own projects/companies, generating more value for the entire chain.

Focus on creating time for devs -- they will love it.
